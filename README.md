# digiits-task-api
Overview
Build a RESTful API for a simple task management system. The API should allow users to manage their tasks, which include creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) tasks. Each task will have a title, description, status, and due date. The project should also include user authentication and authorization.

Requirements
Use Node.js with Express for the server.
Use TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.
Use ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting.
Use Docker to containerize the application.
Use Knex.js for database migrations and querying.
Use PostgreSQL as the database.
